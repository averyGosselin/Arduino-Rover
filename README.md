# Arduino-Rover
A fun project for me to mess around with 3D-printing, programming, circuitry, and whatever other random parts might get dreamt up.

I should really maintain this better. But feel free to find in this repo some various ways I have tried to take this, adding in different features and all that jazz. I will put code, 3D files, and maybe some pictures in here for fun
