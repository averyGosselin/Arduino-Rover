# Arduino-Rover
Just a fun project doing some 3D printing, programming, and fiddling with electronics!

There is a lot that needs to be done to improve the current design, and infinite possibilities for what new features could be added!

If you come up with any cool new features, maybe you make it self driving, maybe you make it do flips, or maybe you add a flamethrower, whatever you do I would love to see it, hopefully this serves as a decent starting point for other fun projects that want to experiment with Arduinos.
