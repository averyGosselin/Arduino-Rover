# Arduino-Rover
This project is a very simple and fun way to start messing around with 3D-printing, programming, circuitry, and whatever other cool things you might add. With just a simple chassis for carrying around all the essential components to the basic functions of the project (Arduino, servo, a motor, and a breadboard, assuming you don't want nasty wires), you should hopefully be able to relatively easily plug and play new features, or just try and hone your skills with the basics! Whether you want to make it self driving, have it do flips, or add a flamethrower, this little rover can do anything (or at least look hilarious trying to)!

Assembly instructions to be added later (get your hot glue ready).
